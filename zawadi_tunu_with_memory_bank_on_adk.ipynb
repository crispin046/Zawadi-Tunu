            "*   **DUPLO Blocks:** These are perfect for this age – large enough to be safe, easy to connect, and allow for endless creative building.\n",
            "*   **Magnetic Tiles (e.g., Magna-Tiles, PicassoTiles):** These are fantastic for open-ended play, understanding shapes, and building complex structures. They can be a bit of an investment but last for years.\n",
            "*   **Large Wooden Blocks:** Classic and durable, great for building towers, houses, or anything they can imagine.\n",

            "*   **Play Kitchen or Food Set:** A perennial favorite! Kids love mimicking adults. You can add a set of play food, pots and pans, or an apron.\n",
            "*   **Dress-Up Clothes:** Capes, crowns, animal costumes, or everyday \"adult\" clothes (like a doctor's coat or firefighter's hat).\n",
            "*   **Dollhouse or Figurines:** Simple dollhouses with chunky figures, or sets like a toy farm with animals, encourage storytelling.\n",
            "*   **Doctor's Kit:** Another great role-play option that can help ease fears about going to the doctor.\n",

            "*   **Simple Puzzles:** Chunky wooden puzzles or jigsaw puzzles with 12-24 pieces.\n",

            "Agent Response:  That's wonderful! Three-year-olds are at such a fun age for gifts, as they're developing so many new skills and their imaginations are really blossoming.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are some recommendations for your three-year-old niece, broken down by type:\n",
            "\n",
            "**1. Creative & Art Supplies:**\n",
            "*   **Washable Art Supplies:** Think chunky crayons, markers, finger paints, or even an easel with paper rolls. Washable is key!\n",
            "*   **Play-Doh Sets:** These are always a hit, promoting fine motor skills and imaginative play. Look for sets with tools like rollers and cutters.\n",
            "*   **Sticker Books:** Reusable sticker books or large sticker scene books can keep them engaged for a while.\n",
            "*   **Simple Craft Kits:** Kits designed for toddlers, like mosaic sticker art or chunky bead threading.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Building & Construction:**\n",
            "*   **DUPLO Blocks:** These are perfect for this age – large enough to be safe, easy to connect, and allow for endless creative building.\n",
            "*   **Magnetic Tiles (e.g., Magna-Tiles, PicassoTiles):** These are fantastic for open-ended play, understanding shapes, and building complex structures. They can be a bit of an investment but last for years.\n",
            "*   **Large Wooden Blocks:** Classic and durable, great for building towers, houses, or anything they can imagine.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Imaginative & Role Play:**\n",
            "*   **Play Kitchen or Food Set:** A perennial favorite! Kids love mimicking adults. You can add a set of play food, pots and pans, or an apron.\n",
            "*   **Dress-Up Clothes:** Capes, crowns, animal costumes, or everyday \"adult\" clothes (like a doctor's coat or firefighter's hat).\n",
            "*   **Dollhouse or Figurines:** Simple dollhouses with chunky figures, or sets like a toy farm with animals, encourage storytelling.\n",
            "*   **Doctor's Kit:** Another great role-play option that can help ease fears about going to the doctor.\n",
            "*   **Puppets:** Hand puppets or finger puppets can spark creative storytelling.\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Outdoor & Gross Motor Skills:**\n",
            "*   **Tricycle or Balance Bike:** Great for developing coordination and getting some energy out. (Don't forget a helmet!)\n",
            "*   **Scooter (3-wheeled):** A stable, three-wheeled scooter is perfect for a three-year-old learning to balance.\n",
            "*   **Sand and Water Table:** Fantastic for sensory play, especially if she has a yard or outdoor space.\n",
            "*   **Small Trampoline (with handle):** Great for indoor energy release, often with a safety bar.\n",
            "*   **Bubble Machine:** Always a winner!\n",
            "\n",
            "**5. Books & Learning:**\n",
            "*   **Picture Books:** Look for engaging stories, lift-the-flap books, or interactive sound books. Books that cover emotions, friendships, or everyday routines are great.\n",
            "*   **Simple Puzzles:** Chunky wooden puzzles or jigsaw puzzles with 12-24 pieces.\n",
            "*   **Musical Instruments:** A toy keyboard, shakers, or a drum can introduce them to music.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Tips for Choosing:**\n",
            "*   **Consider her existing interests:** Does she love animals, princesses, cars, or helping in the kitchen?\n",
            "*   **Ask her parents:** They might have a wish list or know what she already has plenty of.\n",
            "*   **Look for open-ended toys:** Toys that can be played with in many different ways will hold her interest longer than those with a single function.\n",
            "*   **Safety first:** Always check for age recommendations and ensure there are no small parts that could be choking hazards.\n",
            "\n",
            "I hope this gives you some great ideas for finding the perfect gift for your niece!\n"

            "1.  **Balance Bikes (Highly Recommended!)**\n",
            "    *   **What they are:** A balance bike is a two-wheeled bike without pedals. The child pushes off the ground with their feet to propel themselves forward, essentially learning to balance and steer before they learn to pedal.\n",
            "    *   **Why they're great for 3-year-olds:**\n",
            "        *   **Teaches Balance First:** This is the most crucial skill for riding a bike, and balance bikes teach it intuitively and quickly. Kids learn to glide with their feet up.\n",
            "        *   **Builds Confidence:** Without the added complexity of pedals, children feel more in control and less likely to fall, building their confidence.\n",
            "        *   **Smooth Transition to Pedal Bikes:** Most kids who master a balance bike transition to a pedal bike (without training wheels) very easily, often within minutes or hours, because they've already mastered the balancing act.\n",
            "        *   **Gross Motor Skill Development:** Excellent for coordination, spatial awareness, and strengthening leg muscles.\n",
            "    *   **What to look for:**\n",
            "        *   **Lightweight Frame:** Makes it easier for them to maneuver and pick up if they fall.\n",
            "        *   **Adjustable Seat and Handlebars:** Essential for ensuring a proper fit as they grow. Her feet should be able to touch the ground flat-footed or with a slight bend in the knee.\n",
            "        *   **Footrests (Optional but nice):** Some models have small footrests where they can rest their feet while gliding.\n",
            "        *   **Pneumatic (air-filled) tires:** Provide a smoother ride than foam tires, especially on varied terrain.\n",

            "        *   **Doesn't Teach Balance:** While fun, tricycles don't help with the crucial skill of balancing on two wheels, so the transition to a two-wheel bike will still be challenging.\n",
            "        *   **Less Maneuverable:** Can be harder to steer for a young child compared to a balance bike.\n",
            "    *   **Best for:** Kids who might struggle with the concept of a balance bike, or if the primary goal is just gentle pedaling and outdoor fun without the immediate aim of transitioning to a two-wheeler.\n",

              "   \n",
              "   **1. Creative & Art Supplies:**\n",
              "   *   **Washable Art Supplies:** Think chunky crayons, markers, finger paints, or even an easel with paper rolls. Washable is key!\n",
              "   *   **Play-Doh Sets:** These are always a hit, promoting fine motor skills and imaginative play. Look for sets with tools like rollers and cutters.\n",
              "   *   **Sticker Books:** Reusable sticker books or large sticker scene books can keep them engaged for a while.\n",
              "   *   **Simple Craft Kits:** Kits designed for toddlers, like mosaic sticker art or chunky bead threading.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **2. Building & Construction:**\n",
              "   *   **DUPLO Blocks:** These are perfect for this age – large enough to be safe, easy to connect, and allow for endless creative building.\n",
              "   *   **Magnetic Tiles (e.g., Magna-Tiles, PicassoTiles):** These are fantastic for open-ended play, understanding shapes, and building complex structures. They can be a bit of an investment but last for years.\n",
              "   *   **Large Wooden Blocks:** Classic and durable, great for building towers, houses, or anything they can imagine.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **3. Imaginative & Role Play:**\n",
              "   *   **Play Kitchen or Food Set:** A perennial favorite! Kids love mimicking adults. You can add a set of play food, pots and pans, or an apron.\n",
              "   *   **Dress-Up Clothes:** Capes, crowns, animal costumes, or everyday \"adult\" clothes (like a doctor's coat or firefighter's hat).\n",
              "   *   **Dollhouse or Figurines:** Simple dollhouses with chunky figures, or sets like a toy farm with animals, encourage storytelling.\n",
              "   *   **Doctor's Kit:** Another great role-play option that can help ease fears about going to the doctor.\n",
              "   *   **Puppets:** Hand puppets or finger puppets can spark creative storytelling.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **4. Outdoor & Gross Motor Skills:**\n",
              "   *   **Tricycle or Balance Bike:** Great for developing coordination and getting some energy out. (Don't forget a helmet!)\n",
              "   *   **Scooter (3-wheeled):** A stable, three-wheeled scooter is perfect for a three-year-old learning to balance.\n",
              "   *   **Sand and Water Table:** Fantastic for sensory play, especially if she has a yard or outdoor space.\n",
              "   *   **Small Trampoline (with handle):** Great for indoor energy release, often with a safety bar.\n",
              "   *   **Bubble Machine:** Always a winner!\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **5. Books & Learning:**\n",
              "   *   **Picture Books:** Look for engaging stories, lift-the-flap books, or interactive sound books. Books that cover emotions, friendships, or everyday routines are great.\n",
              "   *   **Simple Puzzles:** Chunky wooden puzzles or jigsaw puzzles with 12-24 pieces.\n",
              "   *   **Musical Instruments:** A toy keyboard, shakers, or a drum can introduce them to music.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **Tips for Choosing:**\n",
              "   *   **Consider her existing interests:** Does she love animals, princesses, cars, or helping in the kitchen?\n",
              "   *   **Ask her parents:** They might have a wish list or know what she already has plenty of.\n",
              "   *   **Look for open-ended toys:** Toys that can be played with in many different ways will hold her interest longer than those with a single function.\n",
              "   *   **Safety first:** Always check for age recommendations and ensure there are no small parts that could be choking hazards.\n",

For a three-year-old, there are definitely age-appropriate options that are much better than trying to teach them on a traditional two-wheeler with training wheels right away.\n",
              "   \n",

              "   \n",
              "   1.  **Balance Bikes (Highly Recommended!)**\n",
              "       *   **What they are:** A balance bike is a two-wheeled bike without pedals. The child pushes off the ground with their feet to propel themselves forward, essentially learning to balance and steer before they learn to pedal.\n",
              "       *   **Why they're great for 3-year-olds:**\n",
              "           *   **Teaches Balance First:** This is the most crucial skill for riding a bike, and balance bikes teach it intuitively and quickly. Kids learn to glide with their feet up.\n",
              "           *   **Builds Confidence:** Without the added complexity of pedals, children feel more in control and less likely to fall, building their confidence.\n",
              "           *   **Smooth Transition to Pedal Bikes:** Most kids who master a balance bike transition to a pedal bike (without training wheels) very easily, often within minutes or hours, because they've already mastered the balancing act.\n",
              "           *   **Gross Motor Skill Development:** Excellent for coordination, spatial awareness, and strengthening leg muscles.\n",
              "       *   **What to look for:**\n",
              "           *   **Lightweight Frame:** Makes it easier for them to maneuver and pick up if they fall.\n",
              "           *   **Adjustable Seat and Handlebars:** Essential for ensuring a proper fit as they grow. Her feet should be able to touch the ground flat-footed or with a slight bend in the knee.\n",
              "           *   **Footrests (Optional but nice):** Some models have small footrests where they can rest their feet while gliding.\n",
              "           *   **Pneumatic (air-filled) tires:** Provide a smoother ride than foam tires, especially on varied terrain.\n",
              "       *   **Popular Brands:** Strider, Woom, Joovy, Early Rider, KaZAM.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   2.  **Tricycles**\n",
              "       *   **What they are:** Three-wheeled bikes, some with a push handle for parents.\n",
              "       *   **Why they're an option:**\n",
              "           *   **Stability:** Very stable due to three wheels, so no balancing is required.\n",
              "           *   **Early Pedaling Practice:** Allows them to practice pedaling motions.\n",
              "           *   **Parental Control (with push handle):** Some models allow parents to steer and push, which can be nice for longer walks.\n",
              "       *   **Considerations:**\n",
              "           *   **Doesn't Teach Balance:** While fun, tricycles don't help with the crucial skill of balancing on two wheels, so the transition to a two-wheel bike will still be challenging.\n",
              "           *   **Less Maneuverable:** Can be harder to steer for a young child compared to a balance bike.\n",
              "       *   **Best for:** Kids who might struggle with the concept of a balance bike, or if the primary goal is just gentle pedaling and outdoor fun without the immediate aim of transitioning to a two-wheeler.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **What to Avoid (or postpone) for now:**\n",
              "   *   **Traditional Two-Wheeled Bikes with Training Wheels:** While seemingly a good first step, training wheels actually hinder the development of balance and steering. Kids lean the wrong way and rely on the training wheels, making the eventual transition to a \"big kid bike\" much harder and often more frustrating. A balance bike will get her to a pedal bike without training wheels much faster.\n",

              "*   **Play-Doh Sets:** These are always a hit, promoting fine motor skills and imaginative play. Look for sets with tools like rollers and cutters.\n",
              "*   **Sticker Books:** Reusable sticker books or large sticker scene books can keep them engaged for a while.\n",

              "*   **Dollhouse or Figurines:** Simple dollhouses with chunky figures, or sets like a toy farm with animals, encourage storytelling.\n",
              "*   **Doctor's Kit:** Another great role-play option that can help ease fears about going to the doctor.\n",

              "1.  **Balance Bikes (Highly Recommended!)**\n",
              "    *   **What they are:** A balance bike is a two-wheeled bike without pedals. The child pushes off the ground with their feet to propel themselves forward, essentially learning to balance and steer before they learn to pedal.\n",
              "    *   **Why they're great for 3-year-olds:**\n",
              "        *   **Teaches Balance First:** This is the most crucial skill for riding a bike, and balance bikes teach it intuitively and quickly. Kids learn to glide with their feet up.\n",
              "        *   **Builds Confidence:** Without the added complexity of pedals, children feel more in control and less likely to fall, building their confidence.\n",
              "        *   **Smooth Transition to Pedal Bikes:** Most kids who master a balance bike transition to a pedal bike (without training wheels) very easily, often within minutes or hours, because they've already mastered the balancing act.\n",
              "        *   **Gross Motor Skill Development:** Excellent for coordination, spatial awareness, and strengthening leg muscles.\n",
              "    *   **What to look for:**\n",
              "        *   **Lightweight Frame:** Makes it easier for them to maneuver and pick up if they fall.\n",
              "        *   **Adjustable Seat and Handlebars:** Essential for ensuring a proper fit as they grow. Her feet should be able to touch the ground flat-footed or with a slight bend in the knee.\n",
              "        *   **Footrests (Optional but nice):** Some models have small footrests where they can rest their feet while gliding.\n",
              "        *   **Pneumatic (air-filled) tires:** Provide a smoother ride than foam tires, especially on varied terrain.\n",
              "    *   **Popular Brands:** Strider, Woom, Joovy, Early Rider, KaZAM.\n",
              "\n",

              "    *   **Why they're an option:**\n",

              "        *   **Early Pedaling Practice:** Allows them to practice pedaling motions.\n",
              "        *   **Parental Control (with push handle):** Some models allow parents to steer and push, which can be nice for longer walks.\n",
              "    *   **Considerations:**\n",
              "        *   **Doesn't Teach Balance:** While fun, tricycles don't help with the crucial skill of balancing on two wheels, so the transition to a two-wheel bike will still be challenging.\n",
              "        *   **Less Maneuverable:** Can be harder to steer for a young child compared to a balance bike.\n",
              "    *   **Best for:** Kids who might struggle with the concept of a balance bike, or if the primary goal is just gentle pedaling and outdoor fun without the immediate aim of transitioning to a two-wheeler.\n",
              "\n",
              "**What to Avoid (or postpone) for now:**\n",
              "*   **Traditional Two-Wheeled Bikes with Training Wheels:** While seemingly a good first step, training wheels actually hinder the development of balance and steering. Kids lean the wrong way and rely on the training wheels, making the eventual transition to a \"big kid bike\" much harder and often more frustrating. A balance bike will get her to a pedal bike without training wheels much faster.\n",

            "That's a lovely idea! Dolls are fantastic for encouraging nurturing play, empathy, storytelling, and developing fine motor skills through dressing and undressing. For a three-year-old, here are some great types of dolls to consider:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Baby Dolls (Classic & Wonderful):**\n",
            "    *   **Why they're great:** Three-year-olds love to mimic what they see, and caring for a baby doll is a natural extension of that. They can feed, burp, change, and comfort their \"baby,\" which fosters empathy and imaginative play.\n",
            "    *   **What to look for:**\n",
            "        *   **Soft body:** Many baby dolls have a soft, huggable body, making them perfect for cuddling.\n",
            "        *   **Washable:** Kids this age can be messy, so a doll that can be wiped clean or even machine-washed (check tags!) is a huge plus.\n",
            "        *   **Simple clothing:** Look for outfits that are easy for little hands to put on and take off (e.g., Velcro closures, elastic waistbands, larger buttons/snaps).\n",
            "        *   **No small parts:** Ensure there are no tiny accessories that could be a choking hazard.\n",
            "        *   **Size:** Not too big or heavy for her to carry around comfortably.\n",
            "\n",
            "    *   **Examples:**\n",
            "        *   **Corolle Mon Premier Bébé Calin:** These dolls are often recommended for their quality, soft vanilla scent, and thoughtful design for young children. They come in various skin tones and have soft bodies.\n",
            "        *   **Melissa & Doug Mine to Love Baby Dolls:** Good quality, soft bodies, and often come with simple clothes and accessories.\n",
            "        *   **Fisher-Price Little Mommy Baby Dolls:** Often designed with younger children in mind, with durable construction.\n",
